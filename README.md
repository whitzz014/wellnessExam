Aging is a natural process influenced by genetics and environmental factors. It affects various dimensions of life, including physical health, mental well-being, social interactions, and financial security.

## Dimensions of Aging

## Addressing Ageism
- Ageism refers to discrimination based on age, particularly against older individuals.
- It's essential to challenge ageist stereotypes and promote inclusive attitudes towards aging.
